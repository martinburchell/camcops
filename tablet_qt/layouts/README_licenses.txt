- In some cases these are derivations of Qt original code that permits either
  GPL v3+ or LGPL v3 licensing. The LGPL terms are more liberal.

- A number of files in this directory are therefore similarly licensed either
  under the LGPL v3 or the GPL v3+, to enable broader re-use. See the comment
  headers for individual files, or search for "OPTIONAL LGPL".

Development command-line tools
==============================

If you are developing tasks for CamCOPS, be aware of these additional
development tools.

**In tablet_qt/tools:**


.. _build_qt:

build_qt.py
-----------

This program runs on a variety of platforms (including Linux, Windows, macOS)
and has the surprisingly tricky job of building the following libraries, from
source:

- OpenSSL_
- SQLCipher_
- Qt_

for the following platforms, using a variety of CPUs:

- Android (32-bit ARM, 64-bit x86 emulator) (compile under Linux)
- iOS (32-bit ARM, 64-bit ARM, 64-bit x86 simulator) (compile under macOS)
- Linux (64-bit x86)
- macOS (64-bit x86)
- Windows (32-bit x86, 64-bit x86)

It will fetch source code and do all the work. Once built, you should have a Qt
environment that you can point Qt Creator to, and you should be able to compile
CamCOPS with little extra work. (Though probably not none.)

The ``--build_all`` option is generally a good one; this builds for all
architectures supported on the host you're using.

Here's its help:

..  literalinclude:: _build_qt_help.txt
    :language: none


build_client_translations.py
----------------------------

Builds translation files for the client. See :ref:`Internationalization
<dev_internationalization>`.


chord.py
--------

This generates musical chords as WAV_ files. It's not very generic but it
generates specific sounds used by the CamCOPS client.


decrypt_sqlcipher.py
--------------------

This tool requires an installed copy of SQLCipher_. It creates a decrypted
SQLite_ database from an encrypted SQLCipher_ database, given the password.

Here's its help:

..  literalinclude:: _decrypt_sqlcipher_help.txt
    :language: none


encrypt_sqlcipher.py
--------------------

This tool requires an installed copy of SQLCipher_. It creates an encrypted
SQLCipher_ database from a plain SQLite_ database.

Here's its help:

..  literalinclude:: _encrypt_sqlcipher_help.txt
    :language: none


open_sqlcipher.py
------------------

This tool requires an installed copy of SQLCipher_. It opens an encrypted
SQLCipher_ database via the SQLite_ command line tool, given the password.
You can use this to view/edit CamCOPS databases.

Here's its help:

..  literalinclude:: _open_sqlcipher_help.txt
    :language: none


**In server/tools:**


build_server_translations.py
----------------------------

Builds translation files for the server. See :ref:`Internationalization
<dev_internationalization>`.


create_database_migration.py
----------------------------

Creates a new database migration for the server, in
``server/camcops_server/alembic/versions/``. Here's its help:

.. literalinclude:: _create_database_migration_help.txt
    :language: none


make_xml_skeleton.py
--------------------

Takes a "secret" XML file (one containing task text that is restricted to a
particular site) and makes a generic "skeleton" XML file -- the same but with
strings replaced by placeholder text -- so that others can see the structure
required if they too have the permissions to create the full file.

Writes to stdout (so redirect it to save to a file). Here's its help:

.. literalinclude:: _make_xml_skeleton_help.txt
    :language: none

.. _phq8:

Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item depression scale (PHQ-8)
------------------------------------------------------------

History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PHQ-8 is the :ref:`PHQ-9 <phq9>` with the final question, about suicidal or
self-injurious thoughts, omitted (Kroenke et al. 2009, p165). The final prompt,
about daily functioning, is also omitted (Kroenke et al. 2009, p171).

A score of ≥10 is the standard cutoff for likely major depressive disorder
(MDD); this is the same cutoff as the PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al. 2010). A score of
≥10 has an 88% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression (Kroenke &
Spitzer 2002, via Kroenke et al. 2009).

Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

Six numerical rating scales.

    A. Add scores for questions 1–4
    B. Calculate the mean for questions 5 and 6
    C. Add A and B (giving a score in the range 0-50) and divide by 5

The higher the BASDAI score, the more severe the patient’s disability due to
their ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

**TO BE ESTABLISHED.**

Mapi Trust website states "This questionnaire is in the public domain."

Braun et al. (2014, p. S-100) state "Another major difference between BASDAI
and ASDAS is that the latter is entirely in the public domain while the BASDAI,
since 2011, is only free of charge to academic users while industry has to pay
because of a copyright held by A. Calin represented by the MAPI trust (Mapi
Research Trust, 27 rue de la Villette, 69003 Lyon, France).

Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0)
-----------------------------------------------------

The EDE-Q is the questionnaire version of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE)
interview. There are four subscales. To calculate a subscale score, calculate
the arithmetic mean of the relevant rated items in the scale (listed below). In
our implementation all applicable questions are mandatory so all items will have
been rated. The overall 'global' score is the arithmetic mean of the four
subscales.

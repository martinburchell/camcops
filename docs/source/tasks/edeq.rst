Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0)
-----------------------------------------------------

**NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

The EDE, and its self-report version, the EDE-Q, generate two types of data. First, they provide
frequency data on key behavioural features of eating disorders in terms of number of episodes of
the behaviour and in some instances number of days on which the behaviour has occurred.
Second, they provide subscale scores reflecting the severity of aspects of the psychopathology of
eating disorders. The subscales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight
Concern. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items (listed below)
are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscale. If
ratings are only available on some items, a score may nevertheless be obtained by dividing the
resulting total by the number of rated items so long as more than half the items have been rated.
To obtain an overall or ‘global’ score, the four subscales scores are summed and the resulting
total divided by the number of subscales (i.e. four). Subscale scores are reported as means and
standard deviations.

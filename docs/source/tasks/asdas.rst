Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)
-----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

Four numerical rating scales rated 0-10 and a measure of inflammation (either
C-reactive protein, CRP, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR).

Each question is weighted:

.. code-block:: none

  ASDAS-CRP =
                0.12 × back pain +
                0.06 × duration of morning stiffness +
                0.11 × patient global +
                0.07 × peripheral pain/swelling +
                0.58 × ln(CRP + 1)

    ... where CRP is measured in mg/L

  ASDAS-ESR =
                0.08 x back pain +
                0.07 x duration of morning stiffness +
                0.11 x patient global +
                0.09 x peripheral pain/swelling +
                0.29 x √(ESR)

    ... where ESR is measured in mm/h

**TO BE ESTABLISHED.** Original paper (Lukas et al. 2009) is copyright 2009 BMJ
Publishing Group and European League Against Rheumatism, but status of task
itself less clear.

Braun et al. (2014, p. S-100) state "Another major difference between BASDAI
and ASDAS is that the latter is entirely in the public domain..."; the last
author (van der Heijde) is also the last author of the original article.

Short UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale (SUPPS-P)
------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

20 items, rated on a 4 point scale: strongly agree - strongly disagree.

Scored 1 - 4, with higher ratings indicating stronger disagreement. 5
subscales, each averaged individually: negative urgency (items 6, 8, 13, 15),
lack of perseverance (items 1, 4, 7, 11), lack of premeditation (items 2, 5,
12, 19), sensation seeking (items 9, 14, 16, 18) and positive urgency (items 3,
10, 17, 20). Items 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 are reverse
coded. 2nd order factors are emotion based rash action (negative and positive
urgency), sensation seeking, and deficits in conscientiousness (perseverence
and premeditation).

The minimum score on any subscale is 4 and the maximum is 16.


Coding
~~~~~~

- "Standard" items provide statements to endorse of the type "I am not
  impulsive", and score 1 for strongly agree through to 4 for strongly
  disagree; higher ratings therefore indicate greater impulsivity.

- "Reversed" items provide statements to endorse of the type "I am impulsive",
  and are reverse-scored ("strongly disagree" scores 1; "strongly agree" scores
  4).

- The SUPPS-P uses the term "reverse coded" (e.g.
  http://www.impulsivity.org/measurement/UPPS-P_short_version.pdf) but also
  provides a paper grid in which "1" always maps to "agree strongly" (etc.).

- CamCOPS stores the **scores**.

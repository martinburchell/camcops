Copyright Royal College of Psychiatrists.

Ignore this (say the RCPsych in 2013): “Users may reproduce the scale without
further permission providing they respect copyright by quoting the names of the
authors, the title and the source of the paper in all reproduced copies.” (Cox
et al. 1987.)

Instead, use this (say the RCPsych in 2013): “© 1987 The Royal College of
Psychiatrists. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale may be photocopied by
individual researchers or clinicians for their own use without seeking
permission from the publishers. The scale must be copied in full and all copies
must acknowledge the following source: Cox, J.L., Holden, J.M., & Sagovsky, R.
(1987). Detection of postnatal depression. Development of the 10-item Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale. British Journal of Psychiatry, 150, 782-786.
Written permission must be obtained from the Royal College of Psychiatrists for
copying and distribution to others or for republication (in print, online or by
any other medium).”

Permission refused for full embedding in CamCOPS (personal communication,
RCPsych to Rudolf Cardinal, 2013-08-06).

In CamCOPS, this task is therefore not implemented in full; it is a skeleton
data collection task that may be upgraded if the local institution has
appropriate permissions from the RCPsych.

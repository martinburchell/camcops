EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level Health Scale (EQ-5D-5L)
----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

A descriptive system comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5
levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and
extreme problems. The second task component is a visual scale wherein the
patient is asked to rate their health on a scale of 0 to 100.

EQ-5D-5L evolved from EQ-5D-3L, as the five level classifier provided greater
discriminative ability and more power to detect differences between groups.

    EuroQol | 28 Mar 2022                                       View online [1]

    Dear [XXX],

    As indicated in our email from early January this year, the EuroQol Research
    Foundation is pleased to announce that from 6 April 2022, the current
    offering of three digital formats of EQ-5D (Smartphone/PDA, Tablet, and
    Laptop/Desktop) will be replaced by one new digital format that can be used
    on any digital device. From this date onwards, you can request the new
    digital formats of EQ-5D via the online registration form. Requested EQ-5D
    versions will be delivered via the new EuroQol Customer Portal.

    With the introduction of the new digital EQ-5D format, an updated version of
    the User License Policy will come into effect as of 6 April 2022 – see here
    [2].

    * For commercial customers, a new license fee structure is introduced for
      the new digital EQ-5D format.

    * For non-commercial customers interested in collecting data digitally on an
      unsupported platform, the Fast Track – Digital registration route is
      introduced; see here [3] for more information.

    As part of the introduction of the new digital format, we are rolling out a
    library of EQ-5D Representations, which consists of EuroQol Office–approved
    EQ-5D screenshots of the new digital EQ-5D versions. The library consists of
    EQ-5D-3L, EQ-5D-5L, and EQ-5D-Y Representations of all available languages.
    Representations from this library will be made available to registered
    customers for all requested EQ-5D versions and languages via our EuroQol
    Customer Portal, together with the requested EQ-5D labels and EuroQol’s
    Digital Representation Design Guidelines.

    The EuroQol Office–approved Representations will enable customers and
    vendors to check that their digital implementation of EQ-5D conforms to
    EuroQol’s Digital Representation Design Guidelines. Moreover, as we are
    providing these Representations for all available languages, customers can
    also verify the correct placement of all EQ-5D labels. This means that from
    6 April 2022, customers will be solely responsible for checking the
    correctness of all digital EQ-5D implementations. Screenshot review by the
    EuroQol Office team will no longer be mandatory. However, as a service, the
    Office team will continue to do screenshot reviews on request.

    Lastly, the EuroQol Research Foundation will continue with making EQ-5D
    available free for non-commercial use, after registration. As screenshot
    review is no longer required, a screenshot review fee will no longer be
    charged to non-commercial customers who collect data on unsupported digital
    platforms (i.e. on platforms other than REDCap, LimeSurvey, Qualtrics, or
    Castor EDC); see here [3] for more information.

    For more information and FAQs, please see here [3].

    If you have any questions, please contact the EuroQol Office at
    digitaldatacollection@euroqol.org.

    Best wishes,

    Bernhard Slaap. PhD
    Executive Director
    EuroQol Research Foundation

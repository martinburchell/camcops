Internet Severity and Activities Addiction Questionnaire, 10-items (ISAAQ-10)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A questionnaire about problematic internet use. The original ISAAQ task
consisted of a 15-item severity scale (Part A) and an activities list (Part
B). ISAAQ-10 replaces Part A with a 10-item subset of the original 15. Part B
remains unchanged. The original ISAAQ should no longer be used and has been
removed from CamCOPS.

Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ElixhauserCI)
-------------------------------------------

A count (0-31) of the number of categories of comorbidity that someone has,
based on the :ref:`International Classification of Diseases <diagnosis_icd10>`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The paper Quan et al. (2005), which develops the mapping from ICD-10 codes to
disease categories, is copyright Â© 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. The
comorbidity terms (e.g. "congestive heart failure") are themselves believed to
be in the public domain. The ICD-10 codes (which are owned by the WHO; see
:ref:`ICD-10 diagnostic coding <diagnosis_icd10>`) are not used in the CamCOPS
version of the task, which justs asks clinicians to score presence/absence.

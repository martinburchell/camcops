.. _gbo_gres:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- 1 -- Goal Record Sheet (GBO-GReS)
--------------------------------------------------------

For recording goals of therapy. Part of the :ref:`GBO <gbo>` family.

*Minor change* to the original: "patient/service user" replaces "child/young
person", since this is not specific to paediatric work.
"Practitioner/clinician" also introduced as an option for the "who completed
the form?" question.

.. _gbo_gpc:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- 2 -- Goal Progress Chart (GBO-GPC)
---------------------------------------------------------

See :ref:`GBO <gbo>`. For charting progress towards the goals.

*Modified* in CamCOPS because this is a visual chronological track of
information contained in the :ref:`Goal Rating Sheet <gbo_gras>` that is added
to for each session. CamCOPS captures information about a single session and
can track information over time by comparing multiple instances.

.. _gbo_gras:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- 3 -- Goal Rating Sheet (GBO-GRaS)
--------------------------------------------------------

See :ref:`GBO <gbo>`. For recording how close one is to the goals.

It's a little bit difficult to see the difference between this and the
:ref:`GPC <gbo_gpc>`.

| Goal Progress Chart | "Today I would rate progress to this goal...           |
|                     | zero means no progress has been made towards a goal... |
|                     | ten means a goal has been reached fully..."            |

| Goal Rating Sheet   | "How close are you to the goals you want to get to?    |
|                     | zero means no progress has been made towards a goal... |
|                     | ten means a goal has been reached fully..."            |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

The GPC tracks a single goal over time (and, therefore, asks about a single
goal each time). The GRaS asks about three goals at a moment in time. The GRaS
has slightly different of its question(s) and adds a centre anchor of "half way
to reaching this goal". Both are implemented; it's up to a service which one it
uses (or both).

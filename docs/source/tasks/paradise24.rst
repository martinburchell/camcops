Note very slight phrasing variations amongst these, e.g. Q2 "How much of a
problem did you have *not finding things that keep you interested and
motivated*" (Cieza 2015, Table 2 etc.) versus "How much of a problem did you
have *with loss of interest*" (Cieza 2015 Supplementary File 2). CamCOPS
follows Supplementary File 2, the primary metric source, including its
numbering and emphasis.

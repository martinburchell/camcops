History

- List of Threatening Experiences:

  - Brugha T, Bebbington P, Tennant C, Hurry J (1985).
    The List of Threatening Experiences: a subset of 12 life event categories
    with considerable long-term contextual threat.

    The List of Threatening Experiences: the reliability and validity of a
    brief life events questionnaire.
    *Acta Psychiatr Scand.* 82: 77-81.
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2399824

    Defines the LTE-Q, the questionnaire version of the life events instrument,
    consisting (as before) of 12 categories of common life events that are
    highly likely to be threatening. No definitive scoring system is described.

    Uses a scoring system of "the total number of items endorsed" (out of 12).

- The IAM/Life Events version asks occurrence within the last 6 months; then
  about severity of index event and frequency (since age 18) for each category
  of event endorsed.

- The differences in categories from the LTE are:

  ================================================= =============================================================
  LTE-Q category                                    IAM/Life Events category

  *Note: in the draft IAM/Life (prior to 2019-09-15), 8 was "sacked" and 9 was
  "unsuccessful job-seeking"; transposed on 2019-09-15 for better consistency
  with original LTE-Q.*

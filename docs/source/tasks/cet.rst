Compulsive Exercise Test (CET)
------------------------------

.. include:: include_permission_contextual.rst

A 24-item, 5-subscale self-report scale relating to compulsive exercise,
applicable in the context of eating disorders.

Each statement is rated from 0 (never true) to 5 (always true).


History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developed in:

- Taranis, L. (2010). Compulsive exercise and eating disorder related
  pathology.
  PhD thesis, Loughborough University.
  https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Compulsive_exercise_and_eating_disorder_related_pathology/9609239/1;
  EThOS ID: uk.bl.ethos.544467.

  - CC BY-NC-ND 2.5 licence; see PDF page 3 in the preamble.
  - Full scale in Appendix B, page 253 (PDF page 271).
  - Reverse-scored items are apparent from the phrasing but made explicit in
    Table 2.1, pages 79-80 (PDF pages 97-98), namely questions 8 and 12.
  - Table 2.1 describes the five subscales (and factors):

    1. Avoidance and rule-driven behaviour: questions 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 22,
       23.
    2. Weight control exercise: questions 2, 6, 8 (*), 13, 18.
    3. Mood improvement: questions 1, 4, 14, 17, 24.
    4. Lack of exercise enjoyment: questions 5, 12 (*), 21.
    5. Exercise rigidity: questions 3, 7, 19.

    (*) Reverse-scored.

    Each subscale is scored as a mean, i.e. sum of items / number of items (p.
    78 / PDF p. 96).

    - Check: These means appear to compatible with the 0-5 scale one would
      expect (see e.g. p. 107 /
      PDF page 125).

    The CET total is the sum of subscales (p. 81 / PDF p. 99).

    - Check: the CET total is therefore scored 0-25; and as expected, Table 2.3
      (p. 86 / PDF p. 104), the sum of the subscales ("M" values for variables
      2-6) is the same as the CET total ("M" value for variable 7); likewise
      for Table 2.5 (p. 92 / PDF p. 110)

Subsequently, papers include:

  compulsive exercise test (CET).

  - Confirms reverse scoring for questions 8 and 12 (only) (p. 260).
  - Confirms subscale score = mean score for those questions (p. 259).
  - Confirms total = sum of subscales (p. 259).

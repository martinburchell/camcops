.. warning::

    Both trackers and CTVs collate information from multiple tasks. They
    therefore perform a **consistency check** to ensure that patient ID
    information is the same across all tasks. (Did someone mis-spell a name,
    for example -- or worse, mis-file information by entering the wrong ID
    number?) **Beware** if the consistency check fails; you will need to
    ensure yourself that all the data relates to the same patient.
